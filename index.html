				<h2>Update on Public's Reception on <i>Sea Cross: Bible Game</i>&trade;</h2>
				<p>We've been receiving some wonderful feedback and reception from people during public showings of <i>Sea Cross: Bible Game</i>&trade;. When we demonstrated the game at a religious event, children of all ages lined up to give it a shot. By the 
				time we packed up our booth at the end of the week, the game had been played 349 times.</p>
				<p>If you enjoy playing <i>Sea Cross</i> or if you have friends or kids that enjoy helping Moses dodge crabs, don't just keep it to yourself. Share with others. Especially if you have any friends who are into gaming&mdash;share it with them!</p>
