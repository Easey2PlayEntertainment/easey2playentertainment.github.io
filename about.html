            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Meet Azariah Easey!</h2>
            <p>Azariah Easey is a self-taught computer programmer who has been writing code for four years. When he was just fifteen years old, he developed his very first website: <a href="https://krdrabbits.com" target="_blank">KRdRabbits.com</a>, a site built for a rabbit-breeding business that one of his friends owned. After that first build, he went on to publish four editional websites, including one for his local church: <a href="https://www.bazinesdachurch.com" target="_blank">BazineSDAChurch.com</a>.
            </p>
            <p>In the fall of 2023, one of Azariah's friends, <!--<span class="name2Hide">-->Alana H.<!--</span>-->, posed the idea of building a Bible-based video game. Azariah was originally skeptical of the idea&mdash;he had attempted to build a <i>Tetris</i> clone earier that year, but failed. However, in November, he drew a rough sketch and 
            gave it to <!--<span class="name2Hide">-->Alana<!--</span>--> and her cousin, <!--<span class="name2Hide">-->Malia W.<!--</span>-->, so they could add on to the design. A month later, <!--<span class="name2Hide">-->Malia<!--</span>--> had drawn the primitive designs of what would become <i>Sea Cross: Bible Game&trade;</i>. Azariah then took the designs, and, in the spring of 2024, started working with his team of friends, including his twin brother, 
            Jeremiah Easey, in bringing the game to life.</p>

            <p>"It was one of the most challenging, yet fun, development projects in all my programming experience," Azariah recalls. "It is one thing when you are developing a website or are writing a text-filtering computer program, but it is something altogether different when you are developing a video game. It requires 
                the application of geometric concepts and a bit more collaboration between your creative side and analytical side. Overall, it was a fun experience."

            <p>Azariah Easey is currently working towards his bachelor's degree in Computer Science. He is hoping and praying to use his technical talents for God's glory. Easey2Play Entertainment is one of the many ways that Azariah is planning to do this.</p>
            <p>"The goal of Easey2Play Entertainment is to get people interested in the Bible using simple yet fun video games," Azariah explains. "When people play our games, we want them to have an interest in reading their Bibles more. When that desire is sparked, 
                the humble flame can become a wildfire in the person's life, thus bringing them to the foot of the cross."
            </p>
