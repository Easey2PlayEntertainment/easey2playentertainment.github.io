About Easey2Play Entertainment:

- Easey2Play Entertainment was founded by self-taught developer and college student Azariah Easey, who wanted to provide safe and wholesome video games for people of all ages to enjoy. Although he gears his products towards Christian gamers and youth of different ages, he hopes that God can use him to develop video games that can be used to reach out to those of little to no faith
- The first video game released by Easey2Play Entertainment was *Sea Cross: Bible Game™*, an 8-bit style video game based on the story of the Israelites crossing the Red Sea. The objective of the game is simple: help Moses and the Israelites cross the Red Sea successfully by catching sea shells, dodging crabs, using powerups, and answering Bible questions to keep the Egyptians at bay
- Upcoming developments will take time as Azariah Easey is the only developer working on these projects. One video game that is in the process of being developed is a sequel to *Sea Cross*, with more information about it to be released in the near future.
