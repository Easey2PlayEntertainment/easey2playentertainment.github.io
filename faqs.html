			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>-->
			
			<section>
				<h2 class="noAlignment">When was <i>Sea Cross: Bible Game</i>&trade; debuted?</h2>
				<p><i>Sea Cross: Bible Game</i>&trade; was first released in February of 2025, which was the same month that the Easey2Play Entertainment&trade; website was published. <i>Sea Cross</i> later had a public showing at a religious event in Lincoln, Nebraska, three months later.</p>
				<p><b>FUN FACT:</b> There was a bug that was found within <i>Sea Cross</i> that caused it to freeze. It had to be fixed during the showing.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2 class="noAlignment">Do your video games work for all devices?</h2>
				<p>Short answer: yes. Long answer: it depends what device you use and what settings they are set to. Since we currently host our games on the browser, all users must make sure that their 
				browser supports JavaScript, the language we use to develop our products.<noscript><i>(Note: If you are reading this message, you might be using your browser without JavaScript enabled. Please make sure that JavaScript is enabled for optimal product usage.)<i></noscript></p>
				<p>We have run into issues with iPhone support, but we have found solutions to the problem.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2 class="noAlignment">Why is <i>Sea Cross</i> fullscreen not working on my iPhone?</h2>
				<p>Unfortunately, iPhones do not have Fullscreen API enabled by default. To enable Fullscreen API for Safari, go to <code>Settings > Safari > Advanced > Featured flags</code> and toggle <code>Fullscreen API</code>. Power off your phone and turn it back on.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2 class="noAlignment">Why is the PLAY button not working in <i>Sea Cross</i> for my iPhone?</h2>
				<p>For the same reason fullscreen does not work on most iPhones! To enable Fullscreen API for Safari, go to <code>Settings > Safari > Advanced > Featured flags</code> and toggle <code>Fullscreen API</code>. Power off your phone and turn it back on.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2 class="noAlignment">Why does <i>Sea Cross</i> not run well on Google Pixel phones?</h2>
				<p>Due to Google Pixel's high processing power, we have attempted to write software that slows down the speed in which the characters move and operate. However, even with this fix, there have been times in which an update that the Pixel development teams push out 
				causes the game to become extraordinarily slow, forcing us to update our software every time. We are still doing research to find a more permanent solution to this problem.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2 class="noAlignment">How many people are on staff?</h2>
				<p>Currently, it is just me. If you are interested in joining Easey2Play Entertainment&trade; in its mission to reach souls for the kingdom through video games, please let me know and reach out to me. I'm currently not paying anyone, so you would be volunteering 
				for any role you want that matches your skillset.</p>
